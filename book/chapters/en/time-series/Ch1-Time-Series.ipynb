    "Time series prediction is the prediction of future values based on observed values in the past. It can be defined as a supervised learning problem in that it requires finding patterns between observed data in the past and future values. Therefore, in this chapter, we will build a model that predicts future values through supervised learning based on a neural network structure.\n",

    "Time series prediction is a skill that is required in many areas. One of the areas is in the energy domain. Electric power plants need to predict future power demand to secure sufficient amounts of reserved power, and city gas companies need a future usage prediction model to take preemptive measures against meter reader failure and meter reader cheating. In fact, these issues were presented for data science competitions ([electric power](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235606/overview/), [city gas](https://icim.nims.re.kr/platform/question/16)) to facilitate the discovery of new models. In addition, stakeholders in the retail domain are interested in predicting the sales volumes of items for efficient product management, which was also the topic of a data science competition.([distribution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/overview))\n",

In chapter 1, we will look at the neural network structures that can be used when building a time series prediction model, and check the metrics that can be used when evaluating model performance. In chapter 2, we will deepen our understanding of COVID-19 confirmed case data through exploratory data analysis, and in chapter 3 we will learn how to restructure time series data so it can be used for supervised learning. In chapters 4 and 5, we will use deep learning models to predict future confirmed cases.\n"

By doing so, it is possible to manipulate past information to calculate future forecasts. However, if the given input sequence is too large, a vanishing gradient problem may occur that adversely affects model training. Therefore, the LSTM structure, which solves the vanishing gradient problem, is used frequently. We will use the LSTM structure in this tutorial. "

For example, if a retailer wants to predict weekend sales, it may be helpful to consider weekend sales from the previous week rather than sales on the weekdays leading up to the prediction period. By using the attention mechanism, it is possible to manipulate these factors into the model. It calculates the importance of past points in time and uses them to inference future values. More accurate prediction is possible by assigning more weight to the value that is directly influencing the point to be predicted. "

However, SMAPE is dependent on $\\hat{y}_i$ because the predicted value $\\hat{y}_i$ is included in the denominator. When the predicted value is an underestimation, the denominator becomes smaller and the overall error increases. Let's look at the example below. "

On the other hand, if RMSSE is less than 1, it means that the performance of the model is better than the naive forecast method. Let's implement RMSSE with the code below. "
