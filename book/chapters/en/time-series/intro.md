# Building a Model to Predict the Number of COVID-19 Cases

Welcome to the tutorial for building a model for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases.

In this educational tutorial, we will practice building an LSTM model using PyTorch. This tutorial is not intended to serve as an official estimation of future COVID-19 cases.

이번 튜토리얼의 개요는 다음과 같습니다.

**Dataset **:

1. JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data (Source: [Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19))
2. Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset (Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset?select=covid_19_data.csv))

**Lab Environment** : Google Colaboratory

**Model Structure** : LSTM, CNN-LSTM

**목차**:

- Introduction to Time Series
- 데이터 탐색
